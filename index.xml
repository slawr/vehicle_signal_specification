      <description>The tools for generating custom serialization from the specification are written in Python. Make sure that you have the python YAML parser, PyYAML, installed.
INSTALL PYTHON YAML PARSER On ubuntu:
sudo apt-get install python-yaml  On non-ubuntu systems, install from:
http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML  </description>

      <description>Specification format A domain specification is written as a flat YAML list, where each signal and branch is a self-contained YAML list element.
The YAML list is a single file, called a vspec file.
A vspec can, in addition to a YAML list, also contain include directives.
An include directive refers to another vspec file that is to replace the directive, much like #include in C/C++. Please note that, from a YAML perspective, the include directive is just another comment.</description>

      <guid>https://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/branches/</guid>
      <description>A branch entry describes a tree branch (or node) containing other branches and signals.
A branch entry example is given below:
- Trunk: type: branch description: All signals related to the rear trunk aggregate: false The following elements are defined:
Body.Trunk
The list element name defines the dot-notated signal name to the signal. Please note that all parental branches included in the name must be defined as well.
type
The value branch specifies that this is a branch entry (as opposed to a signal entry).</description>

      <description>What is VSS? The Vehicle Signal Specification introduces a domain taxonomy for vehicle signals. It can be used as standard in automotive applications to communicate information around the vehicle, which is semantically well defined. It focuses on vehicle signals, in the sense of classical sensors and actuators with the raw data communicated over vehicle buses and data which is more commonly associated with the infotainment system alike.
A standardized vehicle data specification allows an industry actor to use a common naming space for communication and, ultimately, abstracts underlying vehicle implementation details.</description>

      <description>VSS Version 2.0 released A new version of VSS has been released. The most important changes since Version 1.0 are:
Vehicle as new root node Before, the tree of the specification started with an empty node, followed by an Attribute and a Signal branch. Now the root node is called Vehicle and every following branch is attached to it.
Attribute and signal now elements of Data Entries Attributes and Signals were branches before.</description>

      <description>The figure below explains the idea of a taxonomy as bridge between human and machine understanding of data. It is important to focus on a specific domain to get common understanding and acceptance. The link between two or more domain taxonomies can be seen as second step.
Components of a domain taxonomy A domain taxonomy, like VSS, consists of three important components, which will be discussed in detail in this documentation:\</description>

      <description>A data entry defines a single sensor/actuator and its members. A data entry example is given below:
- Speed: type: sensor description: The vehicle speed, as measured by the drivetrain. datatype: uint16 unit: km/h min: 0 max: 300 Drivetrain.Transmission.Speed
Defines the dot-notated name of the data entry. Please note that all parental branches included in the name must be defined as well.

A web-based JSON viewer can be used to view the spec.

      <title>Enumerated Sensors &amp; Actuators</title>

      <description>A data entry can optionally be enumerated, allowing it to be assigned a value from a specified set of values. An example of an enumerated sensor is given below:
- Chassis.Transmission.Gear: type: sensor datatype: uint16 enum: [ -1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ] description: The selected gear. -1 is reverse. An enumerated signal entry has no min, max, or unit element.
The enum element is an array of values, all of which must be specified in the emum list.</description>

      <guid>https://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/data_entry/attributes/</guid>
      <description>An attribute is a signal with a default value, specified by its default member.
The value set for an attribute by a vspec file can be read by a consumer without the need of having the value sent out by a publisher. The attribute, in effect, is configuration data that can be specified when the vspec file is installed.
Below is an example of a complete attribute describing engine power</description>

      <description>As VSS resembles primarily the physical structure of the vehicle, so quite often you&amp;rsquo;ll find repetitions of branches and data entries (e.g. doors, axles, etc), which leads to hard-coded repetitions of branches and data entries in the specification. Instances remove the need of repeating definitions, by defining at the node itself how often it occurs in the resulting tree. They are meant as a short-cut in the specification and interpreted by the tools.</description>

      <guid>https://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/includes/</guid>
      <description>An include directive in a vspec file will read the file it refers to and the contents of that file will be inserted into the current buffer in place of the include directive. The included file will, in its turn, be scanned for include directives to be replaced, effectively forming a tree of included files.
See Fig 6 for an example of such a tree.

The include directive has the following format:</description>

      <guid>https://genivi.github.io/vehicle_signal_specification/rule_set/private_branch/</guid>
      <description>The private branch offers a way to clearly separate OEM specific definitions and the specification. It helps adapting the specification to the needs of the organisation.
Extending and overriding Data Entries The core signal specification can be extended with additional signals through the use of private branches, as is shown in Fig 3.
Fig 3. Extended signals
In this case the core signal specification, vss_23.vspec is included by a OEM-specific master vspec file that adds the two proprietary signals Private.</description>
